# instasks
Instasks is a personal project regarding my JavaScript/CSS/HTML studies.

Instasks is a task list.
Add your tasks of the day.
You are able to conclude and remove them.
When concluded, line-through style is added to your task.
You are also able to remove them from the list.

Improving tools are still needed and are going to be present in the next version.
These improves are going to be the possibility of add dates (when included or when due).
Also, the task list is going to be fixed, thus, you can close/open/refresh the browser and won't loose your tasks!

Please, feel free to judge and even help me to improve it with ideas!

Best Regards,

Luiz Fernando Pezzi
